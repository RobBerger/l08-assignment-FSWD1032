1. Ran the program as is and got:
we
are

2. Setup breakpoint on line 14 and watched ltr... program seemed to go through the BST part fine

3. Changed BST to lower case... that didn't change anything

4. Console logged ltr in letters.foEach loop and all looks well

5. Console logged letters inside createWords and all looks well

6. Consol logged  createWords(letters) and it didn't have BST

7. Ran with breakpoint at 14... watched temp and ltr... loop finishes with BST as temp... not in array

8. Added result.push(temp); before return result; and that seems to have fixed the problem
